NOTE FOR THS TEAM:

Update README so someone can run it in 3 steps
Add something like:

Clone repo

Install Kaggle CLI + place kaggle.json

Run scripts/00_download_data.sh



Run scripts/01_setup.R

Run scripts/02_load_and_check.R

Commit + push (code only, not data)
In Git Bash (from the repo folder):

===test
bash scripts/00_download_data.sh

MY NOTE ABOUT WHAT WE DID CHATGPT THANK YOU:===========================================================
						IN GITHUB
===========================================================

Git hub:
Create repo:

!Name is for the file where you will keep in in your local computer
yes .ignore
using R
Then, in get bach once signed into git hub run the local file that is the same as what will run in R


=================================================================================
						In Git Bash App on your computer
==================================================================================
common git bash scripts for this project: 

cd /c/Users/rblos/datascience/Deuces

Create the handoff scripts (these are the files you commit)
In RStudio, create these files:

A) scripts/00_download_data.sh (for Git Bash / Mac / Linux)

#!/usr/bin/env bash
mkdir -p data/raw
kaggle datasets download -d taweilo/loan-approval-classification-data -p data/raw --un
kaggle datasets download -d taweilo/loan-approval-classification-data -p data/raw --unzip

#• Downloaded the .zip
#• Automatically unzipped it
#• Deleted the .zip
#• Placed the extracted file directly in data/raw/

#


output:
rblos@kxb MINGW64 /c/users/rblos/datascience/deuces (main)
$

==================
Notes: what exists so:


• GitHub repo online
• Local clone on your computer
• RStudio project correctly attached
• Clean working directory
=======================

=======================
In R Studio
=======================

Open new: Project from existing Directory and select the sub folder in the cloned repo that is now on your local computer; mine is

 C:\Users\rblos\datascience\Deuces
=======================
Then check initialize it in R by running:


getwd()



output:
[1] "C:/Users/rblos/datascience/Deuces"



BLOCK To CREATE DIRECTOR FULE STRUCTURE: 
getwd()

dir.create("data/raw", recursive = TRUE)
dir.create("data/processed", recursive = TRUE)
dir.create("R")
dir.create("scripts")
dir.create("notebooks")
dir.create("outputs")



then run


list.files()
[1] "data"         "Deuces.Rproj" "notebooks"    "outputs"      "R"            "README.md"    "scripts"     





Next: protect yourself from accidentally uploading the Kaggle dataset to GitHub.

Open the file .gitignore inside RStudio (it’s in the Files pane).
If it exists, add these lines at the bottom. If it doesn’t exist, create a new text file named exactly .gitignore in the repo root and paste these lines:

data/raw/
data/processed/
outputs/
.Rhistory
.RData
.Rproj.user/


Save the file.

Quick check in RStudio: click the “Git” tab (usually top-right). You should see .gitignore listed as modified/new.

Next steps (to stay on track):

A. Add the .gitignore lines above and save.
B. Then go back to Git Bash (or use RStudio’s Terminal tab) and run:

cd /c/Users/rblos/datascience/Deuces
git status





============ sitll in git 

In Git Bash, type exactly:

cd /c/Users/rblos/datascience/Deuces


Press Enter.

Then type:

git status


=====IT SHOULD EVENTUALLY BE: (main:)

rblos@kxb MINGW64 ~/datascience/Deuces (main)
$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   .gitignore

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        Deuces.Rproj

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

rblos@kxb MINGW64 ~/datascience/Deuces (main)
$ ^C

rblos@kxb MINGW64 ~/datascience/Deuces (main)
$


===============now COMMITTING::


Now the next steps are straightforward. You have two files to commit: .gitignore and Deuces.Rproj.

In Git Bash, run these exactly, one at a time (press Enter after each):

git add .gitignore Deuces.Rproj

git commit -m "Add RStudio project and ignore data/output folders"

git push

===
After git push, it may open a browser login again — complete it.

Then confirm it worked by running:
==
git status

==
You should see “nothing to commit, working tree clean.” the Kaggle dataset (as a download script, not committed).
==
You now have:

• Clean local repo
• Clean GitHub repo
• RStudio project committed
• Proper .gitignore
• Working tree clean

That’s a professional setup.
=======================
Now we move to Kaggle.
====================
KEEP IN MIND: 

We are NOT committing the dataset.
We are downloading it into data/raw/.

====================================================

kEGGLE: #1

Next question (important):
Have you already downloaded your Kaggle API key (kaggle.json) from Kaggle?

To check:
Go to Kaggle → Account → API → “Create New API Token”



API Token is now available
Please copy your API token now. You won't be able to view it again. You can always generate a new one if needed.
KGAT_902e7b6bee9695ca633dc523cc6d5555
API TOKEN

To use this token, set the KAGGLE_API_TOKEN environment variable:

export KAGGLE_API_TOKEN=KGAT_902e7b6bee9695ca633dc523cc6d5555
After setting KAGGLE_API_TOKEN, you can use the client as follows:
