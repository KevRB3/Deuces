COmmitt:

Assuming you are already inside your repo folder (you see (main) at the end of the prompt), paste this exactly:


cd /c/Users/rblos/datascience/Deuces
git add .
git commit -m "Update EDA and data audit scripts"
git push


That’s it.

If you are NOT sure you’re in the repo folder, first run:

cd /c/Users/rblos/datascience/Deuces


Then run:

git status


If it says:

On branch main


You’re good.

Then run the three commands above.

Done.

Quick mental model:

git add . → stage changes

git commit -m "message" → save snapshot locally

git push → send to GitHub

That’s the whole flow.
